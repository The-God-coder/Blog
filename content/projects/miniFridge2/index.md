Welcome back to the second part of our series on designing a mini fridge using plywood, insulation, a hinge, and plexiglass. In this installment, we'll take your mini fridge to the next level by incorporating a thermo-electric Peltier module and a computer fan to create an efficient cooling system. Get ready to add temperature control and enhance the functionality of your DIY mini fridge.

**Part 2: Adding Temperature Control**

**Understanding the Peltier Module:**

A thermo-electric Peltier module is a device that can generate a temperature difference by transferring heat from one side to another when an electric current passes through it. By integrating this module into your mini fridge, you can create a cooling effect on one side while the other side heats up.

**Materials Required:**

1. **Thermo-Electric Peltier Module:** This module will act as the cooling element in your mini fridge.
    
2. **Computer Fan:** A small computer fan will help circulate the cooled air inside the fridge.
    
3. **Heat Sink:** A heat sink will help dissipate the heat generated by the Peltier module.
    
4. **Thermal Paste:** Thermal paste ensures efficient heat transfer between the Peltier module and the heat sink.
    
5. **Wires and Connectors:** Wires and connectors for powering the Peltier module and the fan.
    

**Adding the Cooling System:**

1. **Attach the Peltier Module:** Place the Peltier module inside the mini fridge, making sure the cold side faces the interior and the hot side faces the exterior. Secure it in place.
    
2. **Connect the Peltier Module:** Connect the Peltier module to a power source, ensuring you follow the manufacturer's recommendations for voltage and current.
    
3. **Mount the Heat Sink:** Attach the heat sink to the hot side of the Peltier module using thermal paste to ensure proper heat transfer.
    
4. **Install the Computer Fan:** Attach the computer fan inside the fridge, ensuring it's positioned to circulate the cooled air effectively.
    
5. **Wire the Fan:** Connect the computer fan to the power source, ensuring it's powered on when the Peltier module is active.
    

**Testing and Adjustments:**

1. **Monitor Temperature:** As the Peltier module cools one side, the other side will heat up. Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature inside the fridge and make adjustments as needed.
    
2. **Optimize Cooling:** Experiment with the position of the Peltier module, heat sink, and fan to optimize the cooling efficiency.

**Conclusion on my end:**
For me this was a weekend project which didn't go to plan. I had completed the electronics on day one, Saturday, and had worked on the building day two, Sunday. This fridge had't ended up working for me because of my hasty approach and shoddy building. But this doesn't it mean it wont work for you. If you put planning and thought into it, it could be a great project!
