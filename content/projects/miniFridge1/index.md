A mini fridge is a versatile and practical addition to any space, offering convenient access to refreshments while adding a touch of personality to the room. In this blog post, we'll guide you through the process of designing a charming mini fridge using easily accessible materials like plywood, project board insulation, a hinge, and plexiglass. Get ready to combine your DIY skills with functionality to create a customized and cool storage solution.

**Part 1: Materials and Prep**

**Gathering the Materials:**

1. **Plywood:** Select high-quality plywood with a thickness of around Â½ inch. Plywood serves as the base material for constructing the body of the mini fridge.
    
2. **Project Board Insulation:** This insulation material helps maintain the temperature inside the fridge. You can find project board insulation at hardware stores.
    
3. **Hinge:** Choose a durable hinge that will serve as the pivot point for the fridge's door.
    
4. **Plexiglass:** Plexiglass, also known as acrylic sheet, is transparent and ideal for creating a window on the fridge door.
    
5. **Screws and Hardware:** Collect screws, hinges, and any necessary hardware for assembling the components.
    
6. **Cooling Element:** Depending on your requirements, you might need a small cooling element or a fan to regulate the temperature inside the fridge.
    

**Tools Required:**

1. **Saw:** A handsaw or jigsaw will help you cut the plywood to the desired dimensions.
    
2. **Screwdriver:** Use a screwdriver to secure the components together.

**Part 2: Design and Assembly**

**Designing the Frame:**

1. **Measurements:** Begin by measuring the dimensions you want for your mini fridge. Typically, a compact size with enough room for a few items is ideal.
    
2. **Cutting the Plywood:** Use a saw to cut the plywood (I used a jigsaw) into pieces according to your measurements. You'll need panels for the back, sides, top, and bottom of the fridge.
    

**Assembling the Structure:**

1. **Assemble the Box:** Assemble the plywood panels using screws to create the basic box structure of the fridge.
    
2. **Insulation:** Cut the project board insulation to fit the interior dimensions of the box. Attach the insulation to the inside of the plywood using adhesive or glue.
    

**Adding the Door:**

1. **Cutting Plexiglass:** Cut the plexiglass to the size of the door opening. Make sure the plexiglass provides a clear view of the contents inside.
    
2. **Attaching the Hinge:** Secure the hinge to the edge of the plywood door and the corresponding edge of the fridge box. This will allow the door to swing open and closed.
    

**Finishing Touches:**

1. **Cooling Element or Fan:** Depending on your design and cooling requirements, install a small cooling element or fan inside the fridge to maintain the desired temperature.
    
2. **Sealing:** To ensure optimal cooling, seal any gaps around the door with weather stripping or insulation tape.
