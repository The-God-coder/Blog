One of the most captivating aspects of the RoboCup Junior Soccer Lightweight category is the weight limitation imposed on the robots. Teams are required to construct robots that weigh no more than a certain predefined threshold, which typically ranges from 1.5 kg to 2 kg. This weight restriction forces participants to think creatively and make careful choices when it comes to selecting materials, components, and overall design.

The weight challenge promotes a range of problem-solving skills among participants. Teams must consider trade-offs between durability, agility, and functionality, all while keeping the robot's weight within the stipulated limit. Designing lightweight yet robust structures, efficient power distribution systems, and streamlined sensor placements become crucial strategies to gain a competitive edge.

**The Kicker Mechanism Circuit**

One of the central components in a soccer-playing robot is its kicker mechanism. This mechanism is responsible for accurately and forcefully propelling the ball towards the goal. Designing an effective kicker mechanism while adhering to the weight constraint requires careful consideration of the circuitry involved.

1. **Power Management**: The kicker mechanism often requires a burst of power to launch the ball. This requires a large power management system. Teams must choose solenoids that can deliver the necessary force without exceeding the weight limit. Additionally, optimizing the power delivery circuitry to minimize energy wastage is a key consideration.
    
2. **Sensor Integration**: The kicker mechanism's precision relies on sensors to gauge the position of the ball and the robot's orientation. These sensors, light gates, play a vital role in triggering the kicker mechanism at the right moment. Integrating these sensors seamlessly into the circuit requires thoughtful wiring and programming.
    
3. **Control Logic**: The control logic for the kicker mechanism involves intricate algorithms that determine when and how forcefully the ball should be kicked. The circuitry for these algorithms should be designed with efficiency in mind, minimizing delays and ensuring rapid response times.
    
4. **Safety Measures**: As with any robotic system, safety is important. The circuit should include fail-safe mechanisms to prevent unintended actions and to protect both the robot and its surroundings.
    
5. **Weight Optimization**: Circuit components, including microcontrollers, motor drivers, and sensors, all contribute to the robot's weight. Teams need to select lightweight yet reliable components to maximize the robot's performance. While we had tried to keep it in the kicker circuit had unfortunately not make the cut on our weight issues. For this reason we had to remove it.
